          <h2>How to Use the Car Loan Calculator</h2>
          <p>
            Our car loan calculator helps you estimate your monthly auto loan payments and understand the total cost of your loan. 
            Here's how to use it:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Enter the car price</strong> - The total cost of the vehicle you're planning to purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjust the down payment</strong> - The initial payment you'll make upfront (typically 10-20% of the car price).</li>
            <li><strong>Set the interest rate</strong> - The annual interest rate offered by your lender.</li>
            <li><strong>Choose the loan term</strong> - The number of years you'll take to repay the loan (typically 3-7 years).</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h2>Understanding Your Car Loan Results</h2>
          <p>
            The calculator provides three key pieces of information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Monthly Payment</strong> - The amount you'll pay each month, including principal and interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Payment</strong> - The total amount you'll pay over the life of the loan.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Interest</strong> - The total interest you'll pay over the life of the loan.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Factors That Affect Your Car Loan Payment</h2>
          <p>
            Several factors can impact your monthly car loan payment:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Car Price</strong> - A higher car price results in higher monthly payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Interest Rate</strong> - Higher interest rates increase your monthly payment and total interest paid.</li>
            <li><strong>Loan Term</strong> - Longer loan terms typically result in lower monthly payments but higher total interest paid.</li>
            <li><strong>Down Payment</strong> - A larger down payment reduces your loan amount and monthly payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Score</strong> - A better credit score can help you qualify for lower interest rates.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Remember that this calculator provides estimates only. Your actual car loan payment may include additional costs 
            such as taxes, registration fees, and insurance. It's always a good idea to shop around for the best auto loan rates 
            before making a purchase decision.
