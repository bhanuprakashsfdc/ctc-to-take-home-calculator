            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">What is CTC vs Take Home Salary?</h2>
            <p>
              Cost to Company (CTC) is the total amount of money a company spends on an employee in one year. It includes both direct benefits (like basic salary, allowances) and indirect benefits (like employer's PF contribution, gratuity, insurance premiums). Take home salary is the actual amount you receive in your bank account after all deductions.
